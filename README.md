it's still under quite heavy development. Much is implemented, except
some of the trivial opcodes, and my current focus is metatables, and
then implementing some of the standard library.

>It's only a VM, which means that scripts either need to be compiled
offline, or someone needs to write a compiler in Lua or Javascript. In
fact (although I haven't looked at it yet) the former has already been
done as far as I know: http://yueliang.luaforge.net/ - so if one
wanted to compile scripts live in the browser, Yueliang could be
compiled offline and run in the VM in the browser to compile them.
